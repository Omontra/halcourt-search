### Hero
**Headline:** How We Work

**Subtitle:** A partnership approach to executive search, built on transparency, commitment, and results.

### Retained Search
**Label:** Our approach

**Headline:** Retained executive search

**Text:**
We operate exclusively on a retained basis. This model creates genuine alignment between our interests and yours, ensuring we're fully committed to finding the right person—not just filling a role quickly.

Unlike contingent recruitment, retained search allows us to invest significant time and resources into understanding your business, culture, and specific requirements before we begin the search. This depth of understanding is essential when hiring at senior levels, where fit and cultural alignment are as important as technical capability.

The retained model also gives us access to passive candidates—high-performing leaders who aren't actively looking but might be open to the right opportunity. These are often the strongest candidates, and reaching them requires a thoughtful, relationship-driven approach.

### What to Expect
**Label:** The engagement

**Headline:** What you can expect

**Subtitle:** Clear deliverables, regular communication, and a genuine partnership throughout.

**Deep Discovery:**
We begin with thorough conversations to understand your business context, team dynamics, and what success looks like in the role.

**Market Mapping:**
Comprehensive research to identify the strongest candidates in the market, including those not actively seeking new opportunities.

**Qualified Shortlist:**
Typically 4-6 thoroughly vetted candidates delivered within 2-3 weeks, each personally assessed for capability and fit.

**Weekly Updates:**
Regular cadence calls to discuss progress, share market insights, and address any challenges or refinements needed.

**Interview Support:**
Coordination throughout the interview process, including candidate briefing, feedback management, and scheduling.

**Offer & Close:**
Guidance through negotiation and offer acceptance, ensuring a smooth transition to their new role.

### Fee Structure
**Label:** Commercial terms

**Headline:** Transparent fee structure

**Text:**
Our fees are structured as a percentage of the successful candidate's first-year compensation, paid in milestone-based instalments.

This approach ensures we share risk appropriately and remain aligned with your success throughout the engagement. The milestone structure also provides natural checkpoints to review progress and refine our approach if needed.

We're happy to discuss specific terms for your situation—every search is different, and we believe in finding arrangements that work for both parties.

**Transparency:**
Open, honest communication throughout the process. No surprises, no games—just straightforward partnership.

**Long-term thinking:**

### Why Halcourt
**Label:** Why us

**Headline:** The Halcourt difference

**Text:**
We're not a generalist agency trying to cover every sector and level. Our exclusive focus on senior Data, Analytics and AI roles means deeper networks, better market insight, and stronger candidate relationships.

When you work with Halcourt, you get direct access to the person conducting your search—not a junior researcher or account manager. This means faster communication, better understanding of your needs, and a more personal service.

We understand the investor-backed environment. We know what VCs and PE firms expect from their portfolio company hires, and we understand the pace and ambiguity that comes with high-growth businesses. This context matters when assessing candidates and presenting opportunities.
